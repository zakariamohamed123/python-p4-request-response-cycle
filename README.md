# The Request-Response Cycle

## Learning Goals

- Build and run a Flask application on your computer.
- Manipulate and test the structure of a request object.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Web Framework**: software that is designed to support the development of
  web applications. Web frameworks provide built-in tools for generating web
  servers, turning Python objects into HTML, and more.
- **Extension**: a package or module that adds functionality to a Flask
  application that it does not have by default.
- **Request**: an attempt by one machine to contact another over the internet.
- **Client**: an application or machine that accesses services being provided
  by a server through the internet.
- **Web Server**: a combination of software and hardware that uses Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and other protocols to respond to requests made
  over the internet.
- **Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)**: an interface between web servers
  and applications.
- **Template Engine**: software that takes in strings with tokenized
  values, replacing the tokens with their values as output in a web browser.

## Introduction

Web browsers cannot execute Python code. To make our views show up in the
browser, Flask needs to translate HTTP requests into Python objects and new
Python objects into HTTP responses. There are plenty of strategies to do this
by hand, but Flask makes our lives easier with Werkzeug- you'll find that Flask
generates WSGI maps for your application with little to no manual configuration
on your part.

Let's take a look under the hood at the request-response cycle in Flask
applications.

***

## Application and Request Contexts

When a Flask application gets a request from the browser, it has to pass some
specific objects to the view function that will respond to that request. One
example is the `request` object itself, which contains the HTTP request from the
browser.

You may have noticed in the past few lessons, though, that view functions do not
take `request` objects as arguments. Since every view function needs access to
a `request` object- among other things- Flask manages requests through
**contexts.**

Let's take a look at a simple view function that uses a request object:

```py
# server/app.py

from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    host = request.headers.get('Host')
    return f'<h1>The host for this page is {host}</h1>'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5555, debug=True)

```

Remember to set the environment variables in the `server/` directory as well:

```console
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5555
```

Running this app and navigating to `127.0.0.1:5555`, you should see the
following:

![Simple web page with the text "The host for this page is 127.0.0.1:5555"](
https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/python/flask-request-response-1.png
)

This might seem a bit odd. While we did import `request`, we didn't assign it
any attributes that would tell it about the activity on our server. It almost
seems like a **global** variable- one that is set outside of our application
instances and views that provides an unchanging set of information. That
wouldn't make much sense as an implementation, though: our application will be
handling many requests, often overlapping with one another while multiple users
are visiting our website.

Flask generates a context for requests after receiving a request and before our
application runs. When `request` is called, we have access to all of that
request data without having to do any configuration or include a `request`
argument to our view.

If you're testing `request` for a specific app outside of any views, you will
have to generate this context manually. This only requires two commands:

```py
# example only- no need to write this out

from app import app
from flask import request

request_context = app.test_request_context()
request_context.push()
```

> NOTE: If you are working in a debugging shell, it is a good idea to clear out
> your `request_context` object with its `pop()` method before moving onto a new
> request.

As the name `test_request_context()` suggests, this only provides test data.
You won't use this in your applications, but you might see it in the tests
for Phase 4's labs.

Flask also has an **application context**. This works very much the same way as
a request context: when a request is received, Flask generates the application
context. When the application instance is accessed, the application context
becomes available to our app and views. This provides information on the
application we're working on and is accessible through the `flask.current_app`
object.

```py
# server/app.py

from flask import Flask, request, current_app

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    host = request.headers.get('Host')
    appname = current_app.name
    return f'''<h1>The host for this page is {host}</h1>
               <h2>The name of this application is {appname}</h2>'''

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5555, debug=True)

```

Flask also provides us two unique objects that allow us to manipulate request
data more effectively:

- `g` is an object that can be used to store anything that you want to store
  globally for the lifetime of a request. It is reset with each new request.
- `session` is a dictionary object that can be used to hold onto values
  between multiple requests.

***

## Handling Requests

Now that we've seen how a request object is created, let's take a look at how
requests are used by Flask applications.

### The URL Map

Every time an application receives a request, it has to decide which view to
run to handle its data. Routes were helpful for defining where to serve our
application's views, but now we need to use our application's _URL map_ to find
the right view from a URL. The URL map is just as it sounds: a dictionary that
maps URLs to the views that serve the client at those URLs. Every time we use
the `@app.route` decorator, a new mapping is added to the URL map.

We can view the URL map for ourselves in the Flask shell. Run `flask shell`
from the `server/` directory for this lesson and enter the following:

```console
$ app.url_map
# => Map([<Rule '/static/<filename>' (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS) -> static>,
 <Rule '/' (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS) -> index>])
```

The first `Rule` we see exists by default: it is a special route that gives us
access to static files through the client. The second, referring to the `'/'`
URL, describes the `index()` view that we made above.

`GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` are request methods that are accepted through the
routes. All HTTP (_and HTTPS_) requests must be issued with a request method to
indicate what task the server is meant to carry out. `GET` requests a
representation of the resource- this is the most common method your requests
carry when you're surfing the web. `HEAD` is the same as `GET`, but requests
that we leave out the body of the response. `OPTIONS` requests a list of the
HTTP methods that a resource will accept. Flask will include all three by
default- but you can remove them or add more later on if you'd like!

moz_http]._

### Request Hooks

As you build out a variety of Flask web applications, you will notice that there
are many tasks that you want to carry out before or after most of your view
functions. This could be as simple as generating a reminder message or as
complex as multi-factor authentication- either way, you'll want to handle these
with **hooks**.

Hooks are best implemented as decorators. There are four types of hooks:

1. `@app.before_request`: runs a function before each request.
2. `@app.before_first_request`: runs a function before the first request (but not
   subsequent requests).
3. `@app.after_request`: runs a function after each request.
4. `@app.teardown_request`: runs a function after each request, even if an error
   has occurred.

Let's set up a hook so that our views all know where our application files are
located:

```py
# server/app.py

import os

from flask import Flask, request, current_app, g

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.before_request
def app_path():
    g.path = os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())

@app.route('/')
def index():
    host = request.headers.get('Host')
    appname = current_app.name
    return f'''<h1>The host for this page is {host}</h1>
            <h2>The name of this application is {appname}</h2>
            <h3>The path of this application on the user's device is {g.path}</h3>'''

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5555, debug=True)

```

After you restart your server, you should see that our hook has been run and
`g` modified such that `index()` now knows where it lives on your computer.
(_Now it can find its way home if it ever gets lost!_)

![Index page from before with h3 text beneath that says "The path of this
application on the user's device is
/Users/benbotsford/Documents/new-curriculum/intro-to-flask/python-p4-request-response-cycle"](

***

## Creating Responses

When a view function spins up, Flask gets ready for an HTTP response as a return
value. This can be a simple string, a multi-line string of HTML, or a
combination of strings and codes.

An important part of any response is the HTTP **status code**. Flask sets this
to 200 by default, which indicates that the request successfully reached the
specified resource and an appropriate response was generated. When we need to
send a different status code, we can simply add this as a second return value
after the response body:

```py
# index() in server/app.py

@app.route('/')
def index():
    host = request.headers.get('Host')
    appname = current_app.name
    return f'''<h1>The host for this page is {host}</h1>
            <h2>The name of this application is {appname}</h2>
            <h3>The path of this application on the user's device is {g.path}</h3>''', \
            202
```

202 is the "Accepted" status code. This signifies that a request has been
received by the server, but that the server has not done anything about it yet.
We could also return 204 if there were no content on the page, or 404 if the URL
was not found.

_For more on HTTP status codes, visit the [Mozilla documentation][moz_http_status]._

There is a third, optional argument that can be added in to create headers for
our response. This is simply a dictionary with keys for the header attributes
mapped to their respective values.

### Response Objects

For a more object-oriented approach to responses, you can use Flask's
`make_response()` function. This takes 1-3 arguments in the same format as our
earlier response: a body string, a status code, and a headers dictionary,
respectively.

```py
# index() in server/app.py
...
from flask import make_response
...

@app.route('/')
def index():
    host = request.headers.get('Host')
    appname = current_app.name
    response_body = f'''
        <h1>The host for this page is {host}</h1>
        <h2>The name of this application is {appname}</h2>
        <h3>The path of this application on the user's device is {g.path}</h3>
    '''

    status_code = 200
    headers = {}

    return make_response(response_body, status_code, headers)

```

This won't change what you see in the browser, but it will make your code
cleaner and easier to replicate (_even automate!_) in other views.

_For more on response objects, visit [API Flask Documentation][response]._

#### Special Responses

There are specific cases where your response is meant to do something other
than display an HTML body in the browser. Two cases are most common: redirects
and aborts.

The `redirect()` function is usually delivered with a "301: Moved Permanently"
or "302: Found" status code. These signify that the URL for the resource on our
server has been changed. Rather than torture the user with trying to find the
new URL, we can redirect them to the current URL for the resource.

`redirect()` is very simple: it takes one argument, the URL for the relocated
resource.

```py
# example only

from flask import redirect

@app.route('/reginald-kenneth-dwight')
def index():
    return redirect('names.com/elton-john')

```

If you navigate to the above link, you'll notice a "404: Not Found" status code!
This means that the resource does not exist for the website in question. If we
want to inform users of this error in our applications, we need to use Flask's
`abort()` function:

```py
# example only

...
from flask import abort, make_response
...

@app.route('/<stage_name>')
def get_name(stage_name):
    match = session.query('StageName').filter(StageName.name == stage_name)[0]
    if not match:
        abort(404)
    return make_response(f'<h1>{stage_name} is an existing stage name!</h1>')

```

## Conclusion

This has been a brief introduction to requests and responses in Flask. These
messages allow our application to communicate with a client through the server.
Flask does most of the work for us when setting up contexts and URL maps, but
parsing requests and generating responses effectively will allow you to do much
more with Flask than you've seen so far. Now that we've discussed communication
with the frontend, let's get started on communication with the backend through
SQLAlchemy.

If you don't fully understand every concept yet, don't worry! Check below to
make sure your code matches ours and look back at this lesson if you're having
trouble with contexts, requests, or responses in the future.
